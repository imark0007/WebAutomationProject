# Web Automation Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial is a web automation framework built using Selenium WebDriver and Java. It provides a foundation for automating web applications, allowing for efficient and reliable testing of web functionalities.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, providing a clear separation of page elements and test logic.
- **TestNG Integration**: TestNG is used as the testing framework, offering features such as parallel execution, data-driven testing, and reporting.
- **Reporting**: Extent Reports is integrated for comprehensive and interactive test reports, making it easy to analyze test results.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: The framework supports cross-browser testing, allowing tests to be executed on different web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Configurability**: The framework's configuration is easily customizable, allowing users to specify test data, environment settings, and browser configurations.
